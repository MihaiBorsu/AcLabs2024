Name of the laboratory: Scripting with Linux and Git
Place: Nokia Garage
Duration: 3h
Materials needed: Maybe a whiteboard and some markers
Lab goals:
    - Participants will know at least 5 basic Linux commands
    - Participants will know how to create a Hello World bash Script
    - Participants will know the basic 5 bash scripting semnatics 
      (shebang, conditional executions, functions, variables, for loops)
    - Participants will know how to clone, commit, push, merge and rebase using Git
Activity timeline:
    - 5' Introduction, welcome at Nokia MN lab.
    - 15' Short lets know each other game. We have a toy and we pass it from person to person. 
      Each time the toy gets to someone new he/she has to say his/her name, his/her faculty and year and
      in case of robot/AI apocalypse what item would he/she found most valuable and why
    - 10' Environment check. Everyone opens up their laptops and the linux terminal. 
      Please check that git, bash, python3 is working
    - 5' Short Linux commands presentation
    - 25' Linux assignment (15 minutes work, 10 debugging)
    - 5' Short Bash scripting presantation
    - 20' Bash assignment (10 minutes work, 10 debugging)
    - 10' Git short presentation
    - 30' Git assignment (20 minutes work, 10 debugging)
    - 30' Other questions, open discussion time.
        - What are those actually used for.
        - What am I actually doing at work.
        - How does a day for a student look in my team.
    - 10' Recap & Feedback.
        - What have we done today?
        - Name a few things that you remember after the lab
        - How did you felt at the lab?

GIT tasks:
- Clone AC Labs repository
- Modify a file, add it to git and commit it locally
- Check if the commit happened (what is the hash?)
- Point the HEAD to the previous commit ("delete the last commit")
- Create your own branch <your_name>/branch1
- Modify a file, add and commit to git locally
- Merge your change to master
- Create a second new branch <your_name>/branch2
- cherry pick the last commit on <your_name>/branch1 into <your_name>/branch2

BASH tasks:
- Create a script to list all the directories named with the first parameter given. 
- Check if the containing files have the executable permission and if not grant it.

Final task:
- Create an automation using Bash and git to sync 2 different file paths.
- The idea is to have this sync in between 2 diffrent computers, but for exercise it works also with 2 paths
- Each path will have a local git repo
- Both local git repos will point to a single remote (one github repo)
- You can use crontab to automate a check if there has been modified files in the path
- if there has been modified files commit and push them automatically
- Think of a way to periodically sync local repos with the remote (crontab and git pull maybe?)
